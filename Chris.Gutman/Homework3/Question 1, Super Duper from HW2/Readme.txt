"Find something interesting, impressive, or funny to do with variables and conditionals."

This is HW3 question 1.

This program takes an arbitrary string and regular expression and finds the first match determined by the microsoft VB regular expressions scripting V5.5.

Things I learned:

+ InterOp works.
+ Working with C# is a lot harder than VB (its a lot more finckey).
	Application.Exit() causes the program to terminate.
